# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Just a rock, paper, scissors game built on javascript. Made as an assignment for TheOdinProject. Helped me better understand DOM manipulation and gave me a good start on the logic behind JavaScript.

## Overview

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game allows users to play against the computer by selecting one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, providing an interactive experience through the browser.

### Project Structure

- **HTML**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the webpage, including the header, buttons, and result display area.
- **CSS**: The `style.css` file provides styles for the elements, ensuring a visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: The `calc.js` file contains the game logic, handling user clicks and determining the winner against the computer's choice.

### Functionality

- Users can select one of the options (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the respective buttons.
- The computer's choice is randomly generated.
- The game calculates the winner based on the choices and displays the result on the page.
